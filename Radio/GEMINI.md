# Neural Sentry - GEMINI Context

## Project Overview

**Neural Sentry** is an intelligent, automated threat detection and news monitoring agent. It is designed to ingest real-time information (e.g., RSS feeds), analyze it for personal relevance and potential danger using Google Gemini models, verify findings via web search, and alert the user through Telegram.

The system employs a multi-agent **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture using `LangGraph` to orchestrate distinct roles:
*   **Profiler:** Filters news based on the user's personal context (location, job, interests).
*   **Retriever:** Fetches historical context from a local vector database (Qdrant) as part of the RAG retrieval phase.
*   **Triage (Agent A):** A fast, lightweight model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to quickly flag potential threats.
*   **Analyst (Agent B):** A capability-focused model (Gemini 1.5 Pro) for deep threat analysis and risk assessment.
*   **Validator (Agent C):** Verifies claims using web search tools.
*   **Notifier:** Sends alerts via Telegram for verified threats.
*   **Archiver:** Stores relevant events in long-term memory (Qdrant) to support future RAG retrieval and context.

## Architecture & Key Files

### Core Logic
*   **`sentry.py`**: Defines the `LangGraph` state machine (`sentry_app`). This is the brain of the operation, containing the node definitions (`profiler_node`, `triage_node`, `analyst_node`, etc.) and the conditional routing logic.
*   **`ingest.py`**: The main entry point for the continuous monitoring daemon. It polls RSS feeds defined in configuration, deduplicates entries using SQLite, and triggers the `sentry_app` workflow for new items.
*   **`user_profile.json`**: A JSON file defining the user's persona (location, interests, job role) used by the Profiler node to determine relevance.

### Data & Configuration
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies (e.g., `langgraph`, `langchain-google-genai`, `qdrant-client`).
*   **`.env`**: Configuration for API keys (Google, Telegram) and operational settings (Poll intervals, RSS feeds). **Note:** Use `.env.template` as a reference.
*   **`qdrant_data/`**: Directory storing the local Qdrant vector database files.
*   **`ingestion_history.db`**: SQLite database used by `ingest.py` to track processed RSS item hashes and prevent duplicate processing.

### Testing & Tools
*   **`test_sentry.py`**: A manual test script to run specific headlines through the workflow without using the RSS ingestor. Useful for debugging logic.
*   **`install.sh`**: (Legacy/External) Installer script for `opencode`, likely used for environment setup but not part of the runtime logic.

## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9+
*   Google Gemini API Key
*   Telegram Bot Token & Chat ID

### Installation
1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Configure environment:
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    # Edit .env with your API keys and RSS feeds
    ```
3.  Customize Profile:
    *   Edit `user_profile.json` to match the target user's details.

### Running the System
*   **Continuous Monitoring:**
    ```bash
    python ingest.py
    ```
*   **Manual Testing:**
    ```bash
    python test_sentry.py
    ```

## Development Conventions
*   **State Management:** The system uses a `TypedDict` (`AgentState`) to pass data between nodes. All nodes should accept and return a dictionary updating this state.
*   **Error Handling:** Nodes function autonomously. If a specific tool (like Search or LLM) fails, the node should log the error to `state['logs']` and return a safe fallback or degradation path rather than crashing the entire graph.
*   **Model Selection:**
    *   Use `gemini-1.5-flash` for high-volume, low-latency tasks (Triage, Profiling).
    *   Use `gemini-1.5-pro` for complex reasoning and synthesis (Analysis).
